# Weather ★★

Built leveraging a React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate.

This app is a simple starting point for a weather app. Using the https://openweathermap.org/ weather API the app pulls in local weather conditions for a supplied zip code. This can be further expanded to include 5 day and hourly forecasts.
